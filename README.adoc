This Minitest style guide outlines the recommended best practices for real-world programmers to write code that can be maintained by other real-world programmers.

https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop[RuboCop], a static code analyzer (linter) and formatter, has a https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop-minitest[`rubocop-minitest`] extension, provides a way to enforce the rules outlined in this guide.

You can generate a PDF copy of this guide using https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-pdf/[AsciiDoctor PDF], and an HTML copy https://asciidoctor.org/docs/convert-documents/#converting-a-document-to-html[with] https://asciidoctor.org/#installation[AsciiDoctor] using the following commands:

[source,shell]
----
# Generates README.pdf
asciidoctor-pdf -a allow-uri-read README.adoc

# Generates README.html
asciidoctor
----

[TIP]
====
Install the `rouge` gem to get nice syntax highlighting in the generated document.

[source,shell]
----
gem install rouge

== A Living Document

This guide is a work in progress - existing guidelines are constantly being improved, new guidelines are added, occasionally some guidelines
would get removed.

== Layout

This section discusses the idiomatic way to structure tests.

== Assertions

This section discusses idiomatic usage of the assertions provided by Minitest.

=== Assert Nil [[assert-nil]]

Use `assert_nil` if expecting `nil`.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert_equal(nil, actual)

# good
assert_nil(actual)
----

=== Refute Nil [[refute-nil]]

Use `refute_nil` if not expecting `nil`.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert(!actual.nil?)
refute(actual.nil?)

# good
refute_nil(actual)
----

=== Assert Equal Arguments Order[[assert-equal-args-order]]

`assert_equal` should always have expected value as first argument because if the assertion fails the
error message would say expected "rubocop-minitest" received "rubocop" not the other way around.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert_equal(actual, "rubocop-minitest")

# good
assert_equal("rubocop-minitest", actual)
----

=== Refute Equal[[refute-equal]]

Use `refute_equal` if `expected` and `actual` should not be same.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert(!"rubocop-minitest".eql?(actual))
assert("rubocop-minitest" != actual)

# good
refute_equal("rubocop-minitest", actual)
----

=== Assert Truthy [[assert-truthy]]

Use `assert` if expecting truthy value.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert_equal(true, actual)

# good
assert(actual)
----

=== Refute false [[refute-false]]

Use `refute` if expecting false.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert_equal(false, actual)

# bad
assert(!something)

# good
refute(actual)
----

=== Assert Includes [[assert-includes]]

Use `assert_includes` to assert if the object is included in the collection.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert(collection.include?(object))

# good
assert_includes(collection, object)
----

=== Refute Includes [[refute-includes]]

Use `refute_includes` if the object is not included in the collection.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
refute(collection.include?(object))
assert(!collection.include?(object))

# good
refute_includes(collection, object)
----

=== Assert In Delta [[assert-in-delta]]

Use `assert_in_delta` if comparing `floats`. Assertion passes if the expected value is within the `delta` of `actual` value.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert_equal(Math::PI, actual)

# good
assert_in_delta(Math::PI, actual, 0.01)
----

=== Refute In Delta [[refute-in-delta]]

Use `refute_in_delta` if comparing `floats`. Assertion passes if the expected value is NOT within the `delta` of `actual` value.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
refute_equal(Math::PI, actual)

# good
refute_in_delta(Math::PI, actual, 0.01)
----

=== Assert Empty [[assert-empty]]

Use `assert_empty` if expecting object to be empty.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert(object.empty?)

# good
assert_empty(object)
----

=== Refute Empty [[refute-empty]]

Use `refute_empty` if expecting object to be not empty.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert(!object.empty?)
refute(object.empty?)

# good
refute_empty(object)
----

=== Assert Operator [[assert-operator]]

Use `assert_operator` if comparing expected and actual object using operator.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert(expected < actual)

# good
assert_operator(expected, :<, actual)
----

=== Refute Operator [[refute-operator]]

Use `refute_operator` if expecting expected object is not binary operator of the actual object. Assertion passes if the expected object is not binary operator(example: greater than) the actual object.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert(!(expected > actual))
refute(expected > actual)

# good
refute_operator(expected, :>, actual)
----

=== Assert Match [[assert-match]]

Use `assert_match` if expecting matcher regex to match actual object.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert(pattern.match?(object))

# good
assert_match(pattern, object)
----

=== Refute Match [[refute-match]]

Use `refute_match` if expecting matcher regex to not match actual object.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert(!pattern.match?(object))
refute(pattern.match?(object))

# good
refute_match(pattern, object)
----

== Contributing

The guide is still a work in progress - some guidelines are lacking examples, some guidelines don't have examples that illustrate them clearly enough.
Improving such guidelines is a great (and simple way) to help the Ruby community!

In due time these issues will (hopefully) be addressed - just keep them in mind for now.

Nothing written in this guide is set in stone.
It's our desire to work together with everyone interested in Ruby coding style, so that we could ultimately create a resource that will be beneficial to the entire Ruby community.

Feel free to open tickets or send pull requests with improvements.
Thanks in advance for your help!
