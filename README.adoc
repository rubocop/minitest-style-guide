This Minitest style guide outlines the recommended best practices for real-world programmers to write code that can be maintained by other real-world programmers.

https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop[RuboCop], a static code analyzer (linter) and formatter, has a https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop-minitest[`rubocop-minitest`] extension, provides a way to enforce the rules outlined in this guide.

You can generate a PDF copy of this guide using https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-pdf/[AsciiDoctor PDF], and an HTML copy https://asciidoctor.org/docs/convert-documents/#converting-a-document-to-html[with] https://asciidoctor.org/#installation[AsciiDoctor] using the following commands:

[source,shell]
----
# Generates README.pdf
asciidoctor-pdf -a allow-uri-read README.adoc

# Generates README.html

== A Living Document

This guide is a work in progress - existing guidelines are constantly being improved, new guidelines are added, occasionally some guidelines
would get removed.

== Layout

This section discusses the idiomatic way to structure tests.

NOTE: This section is currently a stub. Contributions welcome!

== Assertions

This section discusses idiomatic usage of the assertions provided by Minitest.

=== Assert Nil [[assert-nil]]

Use `assert_nil` if expecting `nil`.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert_equal(nil, actual)

# good
assert_nil(actual)
----

=== Refute Nil [[refute-nil]]

Use `refute_nil` if not expecting `nil`.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert(!actual.nil?)
refute(actual.nil?)

# good
refute_nil(actual)
----

=== Assert Equal Arguments Order[[assert-equal-args-order]]

`assert_equal` should always have expected value as first argument because if the assertion fails the
error message would say expected "rubocop-minitest" received "rubocop" not the other way around.

NOTE: If you're used to working with RSpec then this in the opposite order.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert_equal(actual, "rubocop-minitest")

# good
assert_equal("rubocop-minitest", actual)
----

=== Refute Equal[[refute-equal]]

Use `refute_equal` if `expected` and `actual` should not be same.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert("rubocop-minitest" != actual)

# good
refute_equal("rubocop-minitest", actual)
----

=== Assert Same [[assert-same]]

Use `assert_same` instead of `assert` with `equal?`.

NOTE: Use `assert_same` only when there is a need to compare by identity. Otherwise, use `assert_equal`.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert(expected.equal?(actual))

# good
assert_same(expected, actual)
----

=== Refute Same [[refute-same]]

Use `refute_same` instead of `refute` with `equal?`.

NOTE: Use `refute_same` only when there is a need to compare by identity. Otherwise, use `refute_equal`.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
refute(expected.equal?(actual))
assert(!expected.equal?(actual))

# good
refute_same(expected, actual)
----

=== Assert Truthy [[assert-truthy]]

Use `assert` if expecting truthy value.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert_equal(true, actual)

# good
assert(actual)
----

=== Refute false [[refute-false]]

Use `refute` if expecting false.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert_equal(false, actual)

# bad
assert(!something)

# good
refute(actual)
----

=== Assert Includes [[assert-includes]]

Use `assert_includes` to assert if the object is included in the collection.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert(collection.include?(object))

# good
assert_includes(collection, object)
----

=== Refute Includes [[refute-includes]]

Use `refute_includes` if the object is not included in the collection.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
refute(collection.include?(object))
assert(!collection.include?(object))

# good
refute_includes(collection, object)
----

=== Assert In Delta [[assert-in-delta]]

Use `assert_in_delta` if comparing `floats`. Assertion passes if the expected value is within the `delta` of `actual` value.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert_equal(Math::PI, actual)

# good
assert_in_delta(Math::PI, actual, 0.01)
----

=== Refute In Delta [[refute-in-delta]]

Use `refute_in_delta` if comparing `floats`. Assertion passes if the expected value is NOT within the `delta` of `actual` value.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
refute_equal(Math::PI, actual)

# good
refute_in_delta(Math::PI, actual, 0.01)
----

=== Assert Empty [[assert-empty]]

Use `assert_empty` if expecting object to be empty.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert(object.empty?)

# good
assert_empty(object)
----

=== Refute Empty [[refute-empty]]

Use `refute_empty` if expecting object to be not empty.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert(!object.empty?)
refute(object.empty?)

# good
refute_empty(object)
----

=== Assert Operator [[assert-operator]]

Use `assert_operator` if comparing expected and actual object using operator.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert(expected < actual)

# good
assert_operator(expected, :<, actual)
----

=== Refute Operator [[refute-operator]]

Use `refute_operator` if expecting expected object is not binary operator of the actual object. Assertion passes if the expected object is not binary operator(example: greater than) the actual object.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert(!(expected > actual))
refute(expected > actual)

# good
refute_operator(expected, :>, actual)
----

=== Assert Output [[assert-output]]

Use `assert_output` to assert the methods output. Assertion passes if the expected output or error are matched or equal to the standard output/error.
The expected value can be a regex, string or nil.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
$stdout = StringIO.new
puts object.method
$stdout.rewind
assert_match expected, $stdout.read

# good
assert_output(expected) { puts object.method }
----

=== Assert Silent [[assert-silent]]

Use `assert_silent` to assert that nothing was written to stdout and stderr.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert_output('', '') { puts object.do_something }

# good
assert_silent { puts object.do_something }
----

=== Assert Path Exists [[assert-path-exists]]

Use `assert_path_exists` if expecting path to exist.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert(File.exist?(path))

# good
assert_path_exists(path)
----

=== Refute Path Exists [[refute-path-exists]]

Use `refute_path_exists` if expecting path to not exist.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert(!File.exist?(path))
refute(File.exist?(path))

# good
refute_path_exists(path)
----

=== Assert Match [[assert-match]]

Use `assert_match` if expecting matcher regex to match actual object.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert(pattern.match?(object))

# good
assert_match(pattern, object)
----

=== Refute Match [[refute-match]]

Use `refute_match` if expecting matcher regex to not match actual object.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert(!pattern.match?(object))
refute(pattern.match?(object))

# good
refute_match(pattern, object)
----

=== Assert Predicate [[assert-predicate]]

Use `assert_predicate` if expecting to test the predicate on the expected object and on applying predicate returns true.
The benefit of using the `assert_predicate` over the `assert` or `assert_equal` is the user friendly
error message when assertion fails.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert expected.zero?     # => Expected false to be truthy
assert_equal 0, expected  # => Expected: 0 Actual: 2

# good
assert_predicate expected, :zero? # => Expected 2 to be zero?.
----

=== Refute Predicate [[refute-predicate]]

Use `refute_predicate` if expecting to test the predicate on the expected object and on applying predicate returns false.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert(!expected.zero?)
refute(expected.zero?)

# good
refute_predicate expected, :zero?
----

=== Assert Responds To Method [[assert-respond-to]]

Use `assert_respond_to` if expecting object to respond to a method.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert(object.respond_to?(some_method))

# good
assert_respond_to(object, some_method)
----

=== Refute Responds To Method [[refute-respond-to]]

Use `refute_respond_to` if expecting object to not respond to a method.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert(!object.respond_to?(some_method))
refute(object.respond_to?(some_method))

# good
refute_respond_to(object, some_method)
----

=== Assert Instance Of [[assert-instance-of]]

Prefer `assert_instance_of(class, object)` over `assert(object.instance_of?(class))`.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert('rubocop-minitest'.instance_of?(String))
# good
assert_instance_of(String, 'rubocop-minitest')
----

=== Refute Instance Of [[refute-instance-of]]

Prefer `refute_instance_of(class, object)` over `refute(object.instance_of?(class))`.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
refute('rubocop-minitest'.instance_of?(String))
# good
refute_instance_of(String, 'rubocop-minitest')
----

=== Assert Kind Of [[assert-kind-of]]

Prefer `assert_kind_of(class, object)` over `assert(object.kind_of?(class))`.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert('rubocop-minitest'.kind_of?(String))
# good
assert_kind_of(String, 'rubocop-minitest')
----

=== Refute Kind Of [[refute-kind-of]]

Prefer `refute_kind_of(class, object)` over `refute(object.kind_of?(class))`.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
refute('rubocop-minitest'.kind_of?(String))
# good
refute_kind_of(String, 'rubocop-minitest')
----

=== Unspecified exception [[unspecified-exception]]

Specify the exception being captured by `assert_raises`. This avoids false-positives
when the raised exception is not the same users were expected.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert_raises { do_something }

# good
assert_raises(FooException) { do_something }
----

== Expectations

This section discusses idiomatic usage of the expectations provided by Minitest.

NOTE: This section is currently a stub. Contributions welcome!

=== Global Expectations [[global-expectations]]

Use `_()` wrapper if using global expectations which are deprecated methods.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
do_something.must_equal 2
{ raise_exception }.must_raise TypeError

# good
_(do_something).must_equal 2
value(do_something).must_equal 2
expect(do_something).must_equal 2
_ { raise_exception }.must_raise TypeError
----

Check the http://docs.seattlerb.org/minitest/Minitest/Expectations.html[Minitest::Expectations doc] for more information about its usage.

=== Hooks [[hooks]]

If using a module containing `setup` or `teardown` methods, be sure to call `super` in the test class `setup` or
`teardown`.

[source,ruby]
----

# bad

class TestMeme < Minitest::Test
  include MyHelper

  def setup
    do_something
  end

  def teardown
    clean_something
  end
end

# good

class TestMeme < Minitest::Test
  include MyHelper

  def setup
    super
    do_something
  end

  def teardown
    clean_something
    super
  end
end
----

=== Hooks Ordering [[hooks-ordering]]

Order hooks in the order in which they will be executed.

[source,ruby]
----

# bad

class SomethingTest < Minitest::Test
  def teardown; end
  def setup; end
end

# good

class SomethingTest < Minitest::Test
  def setup; end
  def teardown; end
end
----

== File Naming [[file-naming]]

Use a consistent naming pattern of either a `test_` prefix or a `_test` suffix for filenames of tests.

For a Rails app, follow the `_test` suffix convention, as used by the Rails generators.

For a gem, follow the `test_` prefix convention, as used by the `bundle gem` generator.

== Test Doubles

Minitest includes `minitest/mock`, a simple mock/stub system.

[source,ruby]
----
# example

service = Minitest::Mock.new
service.expect(:execute, true)
----

A common alternative is https://github.com/freerange/mocha[Mocha].

[source,ruby]
----
# example

service = mock
service.expects(:execute).returns(true)
----

Choose only one to use – avoid mixing both approaches within one project.

== Subclassing Test Cases

Minitest uses Ruby classes, if a Minitest class inherits from another class, it will also inherit its methods
causing Minitest to run the parent's tests twice.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad (unless multiple runs are the intended behavior)

class ParentTest < Minitest::Test
  def test_1
    #... Run twice
  end
end

class ChildTest < ParentTest
  def test_2
    #...
  end
end
----

In rare cases, we may want to run the tests twice, but in general avoid subclassing test cases.

Note: The `minitest/spec` alternative syntax disable inheritance between test classes and so does not have this behavior.

== Contributing

The guide is still a work in progress - some guidelines are lacking examples, some guidelines don't have examples that illustrate them clearly enough.
Improving such guidelines is a great (and simple way) to help the Ruby community!

In due time these issues will (hopefully) be addressed - just keep them in mind for now.

Nothing written in this guide is set in stone.
It's our desire to work together with everyone interested in Ruby coding style, so that we could ultimately create a resource that will be beneficial to the entire Ruby community.

Feel free to open tickets or send pull requests with improvements.
Thanks in advance for your help!
